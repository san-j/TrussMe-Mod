Summer Research Under Dr. Cook-Chennault

This folder contains the decompiled apk for TrussMe!, the engineering-based educational game. Included in this apk are the changes that I have made to the application, required for an ongoing study conducted by Dr. Cook-Chennault at Rutgers University. We own no parts of this app, and used this purely for educational and research purposes.

The changes made in this app were largely contained in the Assembly-Csharp.dll file.
